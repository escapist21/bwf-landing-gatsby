        Better World School, an Education initiative of Better World Foundation, is committed to raise the level of education and literacy in rural India and help disadvantaged children realize their full potential. The project seeks to ensure quality education for children in rural areas in order to create equal opportunities for all to participate in and benefit from India’s economic growth. 
        </p>
        <p className="subtitle is-size-6 is-family-secondary">
        Better World Schools empower rural children to meet future challenges. Scholarships for the underprivileged children ensure that affordability is not a hurdle. Foundation’s intention and goal is to start at least one English medium school in each of the 25 selected clusters of Bihar and Jharkhand and through them, intervene in the Govt. schools around them to raise the quality of education in the Govt schools as well. 
        </p>
        <p className="subtitle is-size-6 is-family-secondary">
        There are various opportunities for committed individuals and socially responsible corporations to participate in this endeavour – from providing capital to set up the infrastructure and sponsoring students, to contributing towards various other facilities and equipment, such as computer labs, sports facilities, transport facilities or library books etc. One can also sponsor the salary for badly needed additional teachers in these schools. 
        </p>
        <p className="subtitle is-size-6 is-family-secondary">
        Our combined initiative and support will make all the difference in the life and future of rural children for whom a quality education is the only ladder that could help them and their families climb out of the abyss of poverty.
